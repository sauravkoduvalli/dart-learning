/* --- Synchronous Programming --- */
/*
  - Synchronous Programming execute the code line by line, one at a time.
  - Synchronous operation means a task that needs to be solved before proceeding to the next one.
*/


/* --- Asynchronous Programming --- */
/*
  - Asynchronous programming is a way to write program that allows to do multiple tasks at the same time.
  - Time consuming operations like fetching data form the internet, writing to database, reading from a file, and dwnloading a file can be performed without blocking the main thread of execution.
  - Program execution continues to the next line without waiting to complete other work.
  - It represents the task that doesnâ€™t need to solve before proceeding to the next one.
  - Dart provides several features for handling asynchronous operations, including 'Future', 'async', 'await', and 'Stream'.
