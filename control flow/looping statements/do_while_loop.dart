/* --- do...while loop --- */

/*
  - Similar to the while loop, but only difference is that, evaluates the expression at the end of each iteration. Therefore, itâ€™s called a POSTSET LOOP.
  - The do while statement always executes the first iteration whether the result of the expression is true or not.
