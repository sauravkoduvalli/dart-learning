/* --- Control Flow --- */

/*
  - The control statement or flow of control statement used to decide whether other statement executed or not.
  - the code generally executing in sequential order. So, we may require to execute or skip some group of statement based on the condition, jump to another statement or repeat the same statement execution.
  - Control flow can be catagorised into three types:
    1) Decision making statements
    2) Looping statements
    3) Jumping statements

    Decision making/conditional statements:-
    - Allows to determine whihc statement to be executed based on the text experssion or condition at runtime.
    - Also known as selection making statements.
    - Sinlge or multiple conditions can be existed, which evaluates and executed the code based on boolen value return by the condition.
    - Ex: if statement, if-else statement, if-else-if statement, switch-case statement

    Looping statements:-
    - used to execute the code/statement multiple times until it matches the given condition.
    - Also called iteration statements.
    - Ex: for loop, for...in loop, while loop, do...while loop.

    Jumping statements:-
    - Used to jump from another statement or it transfer the execution from current statement to another statement.
    - Ex: Continue statement, Break statement

/*
  Selection of the loop
  
  - Analyze the problem and observe that whether you need a pre-test loop or post-test loop. 
  - A pre-test loop is that, the condition is tested before entering the loop. Example. while or for loop. 
  - In the post-test loop, the condition is tested after entering the loop. Example, do-while loop.
