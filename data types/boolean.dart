/*
  - Boolean values are used to represent truth values, with two constants: true and false.
  - Type bool type has two constants True and False.

  In practice, boolean values often use in control statements such as if else, while do-while and for.
  
  Logical Operators
  Logical AND (&&) - Accepts two boolean values and return TRUE if both of the are TRUE. otherview return FALSE
  Logical OR (||) - Accepts two boolean values and return FALSE if both values are FALSE, otherwise return TRUE.
  Logical NOT (!) - Accepts a boolean value and negate it.

  Short-circut Evaluation:-
    - Both logical AND and OR operators are short-circuted.
    - if the first value is FALSE, then logical AND operator will be FALSE regardless of the socond value. Therefore, Logical AND operator will not evaluate the second value if the first value is FALSE.
    - if the first value is TRUE, then the logical OR operatot will return TRUE regardless of the second value. Therefore, Logical OR operator will not evaluate the second value if the first value is TRUE.
