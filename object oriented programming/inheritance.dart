/* --- Inheritance in dart --- */

/*
  - Inheritance allows you to define a class that extends the functionality of another class.
  - Dart supports single inheritance. It means that a class can inherit from a single class. 
  - Dart doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances. In other words, a class cannot inherit from two or more classes.
  - To define a class that inherits from another class, you use the 'extends' keyword [Ex: class ChildClass extends ParentClass {}].
  - a class that inherits from another class is called a child class, a subclass, or a derived class. 
  - A class from which the child class inherits is called a parent class, a super class, or a derived class.
  - The child class will have all properties and methods of the parent class. 
  - Also, it can extend the parent class by either overriding the methods from the parent class or having more methods in the child class.
