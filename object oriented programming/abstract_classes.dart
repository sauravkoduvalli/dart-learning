/* --- Abstract Class --- */

// Concrete class - Classes from which can create new object out of it.

/*
  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. 
  - Itâ€™s declared with an abstract keyword.
  - They can contain both abstract and concrete methods.
  - Derived classes must implement all abstract methods inherited from the abstract class.
  - Abstract classes can be used to define hierarchies of related classes.
  - Subclasses of an abstract class must provide an implementation for abstract methods and properties.
